# My minimal vimrc

This is a simple and minimal vim configuration that I use.
Honestly, I don't know why I made this. No one's gonna read this... just like my DMs.

Anyways, I'll be switching to NeoVim very soon, so I just wanted to start with Vim first.


## Low-key features this vimrc offers
- Colorschemes: Gruvbox, Tender (Tender is my personal fav)
- ALE for asynchronous linting
- NERDTree for file navigation
- Custom status line with Git branch display / lightline.vim for a clean and lightweight statusline.
- Convenient key mappings for faster editing
- fzf for fuzzy file and text search
- Python script execution with the F5 key
- vim-matchup for matching parentheses, and tags better than Vimâ€™s default.

It uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management.


## What does it look like??

You can use a different colorscheme from here : [list of vim colorschemes](https://github.com/rafi/awesome-vim-colorschemes)

### 1. Gruvbox

### 2. Tender

## If you ever consider trying it out

### Just make sure you have

* Git (for plugin installation and Git branch detection in the status line)
* Python3 (for running scripts with F5)
* fzf (for fuzzy finding)
* Vim of course


## Setting it up

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone --depth=1  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/vimrc.git
cd vimrc/
```

### 2. Run the setup script

```bash
./setup.sh
```

That's all it takes...


## Key Mappings (you may change 'em if you want)

| `n` / `N`         | Move to next/previous search result and center the cursor |
| `Y`               | Yank from cursor to the end of the line                   |
| `<F5>`            | Save and run current Python file                          |
| `<F3>`            | Toggle NERDTree                                           |
| `Ctrl+j/k/h/l`    | Navigate between split windows                            |
| `Ctrl+Arrow Keys` | Resize split windows                                      |

## If something goes wrong

It would be a shame. But the good news is, you're smart enough to fix it.
