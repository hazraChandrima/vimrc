# My minimal vimrc

![what a shame you couldn't see!](preview/preview.gif)

This is a simple and minimal vim configuration that I use.
Honestly, I don't know why I made this. No one's gonna read this... but if you reached here, thank you for your time.

Anyways, I'll be switching to NeoVim very soon, so I just wanted to start with Vim first.


## Low-key features this vimrc offers

- Colorschemes: Gruvbox, Tender (Tender is my personal fav)
- **coc.nvim** for **LSP features**:
  - Autocompletion with snippets.  
  - Go-to-definition, find references, symbol renaming.  
  - Hover documentation & signature help.  
  - Diagnostics (errors & warnings) from language servers.  

- NERDTree for file navigation
- Custom status line with Git branch display / lightline.vim for a clean and lightweight statusline.
- Convenient key mappings for faster editing
- fzf for fuzzy file and text search
- Python script execution with the F5 key
- vim-matchup for matching parentheses, and tags better than Vimâ€™s default.


It uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for managing plugins.

## What does it look like??

You can use a different colorscheme from here : [list of vim colorschemes](https://github.com/rafi/awesome-vim-colorschemes)

### 1. Gruvbox

## If you ever consider trying it out

### Just make sure you have

* Node.js (>= 16.18.0)
* fzf (for fuzzy finding)
* Vim (of course)
* Python3 (for running scripts with F5, not a must-have)
* Also, this vimrc works best if you use any Nerd Font (if you don't, this setup will install it for ya :)


## Setting it up

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone --depth=1  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/vimrc.git
cd vimrc/
```

### 2. Run the setup script

```bash
./setup.sh
```

That's all it takes...

## If something goes wrong

It would be a shame. But the good news is, you're smart enough to fix it.
